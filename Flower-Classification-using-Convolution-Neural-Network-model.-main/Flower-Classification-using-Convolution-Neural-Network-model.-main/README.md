This project aims to classify different types of flowers using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNNs are widely used for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial dependencies in images.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing images of various flower species. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set, each labeled with the corresponding flower species.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model used for flower classification consists of multiple layers:

1. **Input Layer**: The input layer receives the image data and passes it to the subsequent layers.

2. **Convolutional Layers**: These layers apply filters to the input image, extracting meaningful features through convolution operations. Each convolutional layer typically includes rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation and pooling layers (e.g., max pooling) to reduce spatial dimensions.

3. **Flattening Layer**: This layer flattens the output of the previous convolutional layers into a single vector, preparing it for input to the fully connected layers.

4. **Fully Connected Layers**: These layers take the flattened features and learn the non-linear relationships between them. They typically include activation functions like ReLU and may incorporate dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.

5. **Output Layer**: The final layer produces the predicted probabilities for each flower species using a suitable activation function (e.g., softmax for multiclass classification).

## Training Process

The model is trained using the training dataset, where the input images are fed through the network, and the predicted outputs are compared to the ground truth labels. The model's weights are adjusted iteratively using optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or adaptive algorithms like Adam, with the goal of minimizing a defined loss function.

## Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated using the test dataset to measure its performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be computed to assess the model's ability to correctly classify flower images.

## Deployment

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed in various ways. It can be integrated into a web or mobile application, used in an API for inference, or deployed on edge devices for real-time flower classification.

## Conclusion

Flower classification using CNNs demonstrates the power of deep learning techniques in image recognition tasks. By training a CNN model on a labeled dataset of flower images, we can develop a system capable of accurately classifying various flower species.
